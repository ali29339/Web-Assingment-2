<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>11 ounces fresh blueberries (about 2 cups) </li>

        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
        
       <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li> 
        
       <li>1 pound fresh peaches, peeled and chopped (about 3 cups)</li> 
        
       <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        
      <li> 1 1/2 cups whole milk</li> 
        
       <li>1/4 cup light corn syrup</li> 
        
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        
       <li>5 large egg yolks</li> 
        
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>  
        
     <li> 1/4 cup (2 ounces) bourbon</li>  
        </li>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<li>Cook blueberries, 1/4 cup sugar, and lemon juice in a medium-size, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high, stirring occasionally, until berries begin to burst and liquid begins to thicken, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool 30 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Cover and chill until completely cool, at least 1 hour or until ready to use (up to 1 week).</li>
<br>

<li>Process chopped peaches in a food processor until almost smooth (applesauce consistency), leaving a few chunky bits, about 30 seconds. Set aside.</li>
<br>

<li>Stir together heavy cream, whole milk, corn syrup, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup sugar in a medium saucepan, and cook over medium, stirring occasionally, just until mixture begins to simmer (bubbles begin to form around the outside edge of pan), 5 to 6 minutes.</li>

<br>
<li>Meanwhile, whisk together egg yolks and vanilla in a large bowl. While whisking yolk mixture constantly, carefully ladle about 1 cup hot cream mixture into yolk mixture; continue whisking until cream mixture is fully incorporated. Carefully whisk in remaining hot cream mixture.</li>
<br>

<li>Pour custard mixture back into saucepan, and cook over medium-high, whisking constantly, until mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool 10 minutes.</li>
<br>

<li>Stir bourbon and pureed peaches into custard. Pour custard mixture into a gallon-size ziplock plastic freezer bag. Seal bag, and place in an ice bath. Let stand until mixture is completely cool, about 30 minutes.
</li>
<br>

<li> mixture into a 1 1/2-quart electric ice cream maker, and proceed according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. (Instructions and times may vary.) Transfer to an airtight, freezer-safe container; freeze until slightly firm, about 30 minutes. Dollop blueberry mixture over ice cream, and swirl with a spoon. Cover and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.</li><br>
